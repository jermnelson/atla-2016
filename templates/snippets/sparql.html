<h2>SPARQL</h2>
<p class="lead">Much of the power and flexibility of RDF graph databases comes from a query/update 
language called SPARQL - short for <strong>SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language</strong> - that
allows you to search and manipulate the subject, predicate, and objects in your triplestore.</p>
