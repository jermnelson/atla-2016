<h1>What is Linked Data?</h1>

    Libraries and cultural heritage organizations are shifting 
    from MARC21 and XML  metadata standards to Linked-Data vocabularies. 
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/XGR-lld-20111025/">Library Linked Data</a> id
    an international effort to bring machine-readable data to the web. Library Linked Data is 
    based on a RDF (Resource Description Framework) graphs made up a series of statements, called triples, 
    that take the form <strong>subject - predicate - object</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">Linked Data is about representing information
    in RDF Triples i.e. subject-predicate-object.
    like <a href="http://bibframe.org">BIBFRAME</a> and 
    <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org.</a> 
    <a href="http://www.rdaregistry.info/">RDA</a> and 
    <a href="http://www.marc21rdf.info/">MARC</a> can also be reformulated into
    Linked Data triples as well.

                    A graph data structure is made up <em>nodes</em> (also known as vertices or points) with 
                    connections between the nodes called <em>edges</em> or <em>directed edges</em> (also referred
                    to as arcs or lines)

                <p class="card-text">
                    Graphs are used to describe transportation systems, computer networks, and social relationships.
                    Graphs easily support heterogeneous environments with different vocabularies that can scale to 
                    billions (if not trillions) of nodes and edges.

<h2>RDF Graphs</h2>
<p class="lead">
    Linked Data in libraries is constructed using Resource Description Framework (RDF) graphs, 
    a type of directed graphs, where the nodes are made up
    of either IRI (international resource indicator i.e. URLs or URIs), blank nodes (a 
    type of identifier placeholder in a RDF graph), or literal values. Originating with the 
    World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifications, RDF graphs are built using three element 
    statements called <strong>triples</strong> that model relationships between resources, 
    IRIs, and descriptive information.
</p>
<p class="lead">
    In a RDF triple, the first element is called a <strong>subject</strong> and represents 
    a resource with the second element, the <strong>predicate</strong>, describing an aspect
    that connects to the third element, an <strong>object</strong> made up a value. One or more
    triples make up a RDF graph.
